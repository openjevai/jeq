# Providers

`jeq` selects one explicit provider for each command. It does not infer a provider from a credential or silently fall back to another endpoint.

## Direct TypeSafe

The default provider is `typesafe` and its default model is `jev-latest`. Set its credential in the environment:

```sh
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY='...'
jeq models
```

For a local loopback service, override the endpoint with `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL`. Remote endpoints must use `https`; `http` is accepted only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`.

## Vercel AI Gateway

Select the built-in Vercel profile explicitly:

```sh
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY='...'
JEQ_PROVIDER=vercel jeq models
```

`VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` is accepted when `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is absent. The profile uses the TypeSafe gateway path and its default model. Check the endpoint and model with `jeq models` before a composed command.

## OpenJEV

[OpenJEV](https://openjev.sh) is a free community gateway to the same Jev model built by TypeSafe. Select it explicitly:

```sh
export OPENJEV_API_KEY='...'
JEQ_PROVIDER=openjev jeq models
```

The profile uses `https://api.openjev.sh` as the base URL, the `openjev` model identifier, and the `OPENJEV_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication. TypeSafe remains the default provider; anyone with a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` sees no behaviour change.

## One-off custom provider

Use environment settings for one command without writing a credential to disk:

```sh
JEQ_PROVIDER=custom JEQ_BASE_URL=https://example.invalid/typesafe \
JEQ_API_KEY="$MY_PROVIDER_KEY" jeq models
```

Set `JEQ_AUTH=none` only for a loopback HTTP service. A remote unauthenticated endpoint is rejected. HTTPS is required for every remote provider. Redirects are refused by the HTTP adapter.

## Named profiles

Keep endpoint metadata and credential names in a JSON config. Store credential values only in the environment:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "staging",
  "providers": {
    "staging": {
      "base_url": "https://api.example.invalid/typesafe",
      "default_model": "jev-latest",
      "auth": "bearer",
      "api_key_env": "STAGING_TYPESAFE_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Select it with `JEQ_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json JEQ_PROVIDER=staging`. The default config is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jeq/config.json`, or `$HOME/.config/jeq/config.json`. `JEQ_CONFIG` takes precedence over that optional default file. Unknown fields, malformed JSON, unsupported auth, credentials embedded in URLs, and invalid schemes are rejected.

## Model precedence

For composed commands, model selection is:

1. `--model`
2. `JEQ_DEFAULT_MODEL`
3. the selected provider profile's `default_model`
4. top-level `default_model` in config
5. legacy `TYPESAFE_DEFAULT_MODEL`
6. the `jev-latest` fallback

A native `ask` request's embedded model is authoritative. Provider selection and model selection are separate decisions.

Use `--usage-summary` on `ask`, `map`, `rate`, `rank`, or `reduce` to write observed token efficiency totals to stderr without changing stdout. It counts only successful, decoded responses and reports answers per 1,000 provider-reported input tokens. A provider can still bill a failed request that returns no usage; see the [CLI reference](cli-reference.md#usage-summary) for field definitions and accounting limits.

## Loopback Jev-compatible servers

A local server that implements `POST /v1/systemone` can serve judgment commands through the custom provider. `jeq` sends the request directly to that endpoint; judgment commands do not require `GET /v1/models` first. A model-listing endpoint is only needed by `jeq models`.

For example, with a loopback server exposing the System One wire contract:

```sh
JEQ_PROVIDER=custom JEQ_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 JEQ_AUTH=none \\
  jeq ask --request request.json
```

The server must return a Jev-compatible response envelope (`model`, `answers`, and `usage`). This path is offline from TypeSafe and does not add a hidden fallback.

### Laya

[Laya](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya) provides a compatible local server. Start with one checkpoint on loopback:

```sh
LAYA_HOST=127.0.0.1 LAYA_DEVICE=cpu LAYA_MODELS=english laya-serve
```

The first start downloads the public checkpoint from Hugging Face. Review its license, disk, and memory requirements before running it. Create a Laya request with the explicit checkpoint name, then point jeq at the local endpoint:

```sh
jq '.model = "english"' request.json > request.laya.json
JEQ_PROVIDER=custom \
JEQ_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
JEQ_AUTH=none \
jeq ask --request request.laya.json
```

Use `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` for readiness. Laya currently does not implement `GET /v1/models`, so `jeq models` returns an error for this provider. A Laya error does not fall back to TypeSafe.

### Switch between Jev and Laya

Give Laya a named profile in `$HOME/.config/jeq/config.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "laya": {
      "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
      "default_model": "english",
      "auth": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

Provider and model selection are explicit and scoped to one command. In composed mode, change the two flags and keep the same state and questions:

```sh
JEQ_PROVIDER=typesafe jeq ask --model jev-latest --state 'A customer was charged twice' --questions questions.json
JEQ_PROVIDER=laya jeq ask --model english --state 'A customer was charged twice' --questions questions.json
```

This changes no persistent state and never falls back between providers. For native `jeq ask --request` and `jeq validate --request` documents, the embedded `model` is authoritative. An explicit `--model` is rejected; edit the request document's `model` field to change it. `JEQ_DEFAULT_MODEL` does not replace the embedded model. Use separate request documents with `"model":"jev-latest"` for Jev and `"model":"english"` for Laya, as shown above.

## Verify and troubleshoot

Run `jeq models` after selecting a provider that implements `GET /v1/models`. It verifies the endpoint, authentication, and model listing without changing config. For a local provider that implements only `POST /v1/systemone`, use its health check and one bounded synthetic `jeq ask` instead. Common errors:

- `JEQ_AUTH_MISSING`: export the environment variable named by `api_key_env`.
- invalid provider or scheme: use an explicit provider and HTTPS for remote endpoints.
- unknown config field or oversized config: simplify the JSON and keep it below the config size limit.
- model rejected: check the provider's `models` output, then pass an exact `--model`.

Do not put API keys in config files, command arguments, examples, logs, or trace output.
